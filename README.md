# RedNet-tensorflow
Unofficial implementation of RedNet architecture described in paper ['RedNet: Residual Encoder-Decoder Network for indoor RGB-D Semantic Segmentation'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01054). It's a model for "Semantic Segmentation", but fixed it for "Super Resolution" by modifying the output layer activation function.
